# Task 1- API
#The task was to use API requests to get information from the Public API - https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
#The script was done in Colab.
#The Request function was imported.
#Because the script was done in Colab, I mounted my google drive to the program to make sure the file I will save will be saved n google drive.
#After the drive was successfully mounted, we checked if it was mounted correctly and the datasheet was saving in the right place.
#I import pandas to to make sure I will be able to save the data in Excel/CSV.
#I use the get function for all the requests because we just want to search on the website for the information we need.
#What the code does is to send a request to the Public API to get a list of all the dog breeds,
#From the list of all the dog breeds, we use a for loop to verify that the breed "Retriever" is part of the list
#I send another request to get a list of all the sub-breeds of "Retriever", 
#The last request is to get a random image of the sub-breed golden
